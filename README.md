# Eight-Puzzle
In this project, you will get hands on experience about the (possibly) wisest search algorithm: A* search! In particular, you will write a program that solves the eight-puzzle. You will solve it using 

1) Uniform Cost Search

2) A* with the Misplaced Tile heuristic.

3) A* with the Euclidean Distance heuristic.
